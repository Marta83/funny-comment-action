### My Workflow

I wanted to try it out Github actions for a while so when I saw this hackathon I though it was the perfect moment. 

I didn't have any productive idea that wasn't already in the marketplace so I remember that when I started as a developer we have a feature in Jenkins where every build you could read a funny comment about [Chuck Norris](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris), and I loved it!

I'm also kind off a newbie with Typescript so I decided to use it to keep learning. 


### Yaml File or Link to Code

Here is an example of how to use the Action:

You can customise your funny comments with the comment_type argument.

* chuck : Add Chuck Norris's fun facts.
* gif : Add funny gifs.
* all: Random comment between al the options.
